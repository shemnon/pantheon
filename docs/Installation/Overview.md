# Installation Overview

You can install Pantheon by:

* [Installing the binary distribution](Install-Binaries.md) 
* [Building from source](Build-From-Source.md) 

!!! note 
    To run a single node to connect the Ethereum mainnet or a public testnet, running from the [Pantheon docker image](../Getting-Started/Run-Docker-Image.md) is the fastest way to get started.
