<!--- END of page meta data -->

# Install Binary Distribution

## Mac OS with Homebrew

### Prerequisites

* [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)

### Install Using Homebrew

```bash
brew tap pegasyseng/pantheon
brew install pantheon
```
Display Pantheon command line help to confirm installation: 

```bash
pantheon --help
```

## Windows with Chocolatey 

### Prerequisites

* [Chocolatey](Install-Chocolatey.md)

!!! note
    Close and reopen the terminal after installing Chocolatey. 

### Install Using Chocolatey

To install from [Chocolatey package](https://chocolatey.org/packages/pantheon/): 

```bat
choco install pantheon
``` 

!!! note 
    The Chocolatey installation installs JDK11 and updates the system `JAVA_HOME` and `PATH` environment variables. 
    If your user `JAVA_HOME` or `PATH` environment variables are also set, update or remove these. 
    
    If you do not want your system settings updated by Chocolatey, [install the packaged binaries](#linux-unix-windows-without-chocolatey) 
    instead and update the environment variables as required. 

Display Pantheon command line help to confirm installation: 

```bat
pantheon --help
```

## Linux / Unix / Windows without Chocolatey

### Prerequisites 

* [Java JDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)

!!!attention
    Pantheon requires Java 8+ to compile; earlier versions are not supported.
    Pantheon is currently supported only on 64-bit versions of Windows, and requires a 64-bit version of JDK/JRE. 
    We recommend that you also remove any 32-bit JDK/JRE installations.
    
    From v1.2, Pantheon will require Java 11.  That is, Pantheon on Java 8 will no longer be supported.
    
!!! note "Linux Open File Limit"
    If synchronizing to MainNet on Linux or other chains with large data requirements, increase the maximum 
    number of open files allowed using `ulimit`. If the open files limit is not high enough, a `Too many open files` RocksDB exception occurs. 

### Install from Packaged Binaries

Download the Pantheon [packaged binaries](https://bintray.com/consensys/pegasys-repo/pantheon/_latestVersion#files).

Unpack the downloaded files and change into the `pantheon-<release>` directory. 

Display Pantheon command line help to confirm installation: 

```bash tab="Linux/macOS"
