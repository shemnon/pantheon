# Creating and Sending Private Transactions 

The [EEA JavaScript library](https://github.com/PegaSysEng/eeajs) is provided to create and send signed 
RLP-encoded private transactions. 

!!! note
    Private transactions either deploy contracts or call contract functions. 
    Ether transfers cannot be a private transaction.
