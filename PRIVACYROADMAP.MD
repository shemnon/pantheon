# Privacy Roadmap

This document provides a more detailed view of the privacy roadmap. Like [the overall roadmap](ROADMAP.md), 
it is a living document, which will evolve and change over time.  In particular the features in later versions 
are likely to be refined and change.

We use the approach of  `#now`, `#next`, `#later` [used by foursquare](https://medium.com/@noah_weiss/now-next-later-roadmaps-without-the-drudgery-1cfe65656645), with a slightly different time horizon.  
Our now scale is about 3 months, next about 6 months, and then later is beyond.

## Now (up to v1.2)

* Privacy group management added to JSON RPC-API
* Support for external key management 

## Next 

* Ability to add and remove members from privacy groups
* Many to many relationship between Pantheon nodes and Orion nodes 
* Privacy group consensus 
* Cross privacy group communication 
* On-chain privacy 

## Later

* Sidechains
